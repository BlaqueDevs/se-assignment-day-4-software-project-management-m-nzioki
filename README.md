- Easier to estimate costs and timelines upfront
- Comprehensive documentation
- Less client involvement required during development
- Better for fixed-price contracts

_Disadvantages:_

- Inflexible to requirement changes
- Testing occurs late in the cycle
- Client sees the product only after completion
- Higher risk of missing market needs
- Issues discovered late are expensive to fix

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

_Agile is more beneficial for:_

- Projects where requirements are expected to evolve
- Products entering new or rapidly changing markets
- Startups developing MVPs (Minimum Viable Products)
- Projects requiring frequent user feedback
_Example: Developing a new social media platform where user preferences and behaviors will inform feature development_

_Waterfall is more beneficial for:_ 

- Projects with well-defined, stable requirements
- Highly regulated industries requiring extensive documentation
- Projects with fixed budgets and deadlines
- Systems where requirements are fully understood upfront
_Example: Developing software for Government & regulated industries (e.g., banking, healthcare). that must meet strict regulatory requirements and undergo extensive validation before release_

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

_Methods for ensuring quality:_

- Implementing test-driven development (TDD)
- Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
- Code reviews and pair programming
- Automated testing (unit, integration, system, regression)
- User acceptance testing (UAT)
- Static code analysis and linting
- Performance testing and load testing
- Security audits and penetration testing

_High standards are important because:_

- Reduces maintenance costs and technical debt
- Improves user satisfaction and adoption
- Decreases security vulnerabilities
- Enhances reputation and brand value
- Reduces customer support burden
- Minimizes costly emergency fixes and downtime

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining project scope contributes to success by:

- Establishing clear boundaries of what will be delivered
- Setting stakeholder expectations
- Preventing feature creep
- Enabling accurate resource allocation
- Providing a basis for change management

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) breaks down a project into smaller, manageable tasks. It's useful because it:

- Organizes the project into logical, manageable pieces
- Helps identify all required work packages
- Provides a foundation for scheduling and cost estimation
- Clarifies responsibilities and accountability
- Makes complex projects more comprehensible
- Serves as a communication tool for stakeholders

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

Benefits of detailed project scheduling:

- Provides a roadmap for project execution
- Identifies dependencies between tasks
- Helps optimize resource allocation
- Enables critical path analysis
- Allows for early identification of potential delays
- Establishes clear milestones for progress tracking

Gantt charts assist by:

- Visualizing the project timeline and task duration
- Showing task dependencies and relationships
- Highlighting the critical path
- Displaying resource allocation across tasks
- Tracking actual progress against planned timeline
- Providing a simple visual status update for stakeholders

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

I do not yet have a software. But when considering building a software I would think about:\

- What pain points does it solve for users?
- Inefficiencies in current solutions
